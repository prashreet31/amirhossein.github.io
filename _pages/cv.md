## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Associate AI Engineer  
**JTEKT North America, 2024 - current**  
- Leading a team of technical staff & data engineers to develop an AI-powered technical assistant that retrieves knowledge from databases and generates new technical reports within an Azure-based application.
- Achieved a 100% increase in report generation speed while enhancing content integrity, coherence, and reference validation.
- Designed and optimized workflows for data wrangling, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning.
- Leveraged Azure Services, OpenAI GPT-4o, vector databases, LangChain, LanceDB, and BeautifulSoup to streamline AI-driven knowledge retrieval and report generation.

### Data Scientist  
**DataRoo LLC, 2023 - 2024**  
- Led a team of medical specialists, medical coders, and full-stack developers to develop an AI-powered medical coding/billing application integrated with electronic medical records (EMR) systems.
- Created MVP development plan, action plan, annotated JSON dataset, performed prompt engineering and fine-tuning to follow specific medical coding procedures. Integrated with Azure OpenAI service for reasoning and code generation.
- Achieved about 30% higher accuracy and 40% lower cost in EMR assessment than ChatGPT-4o.

### Graduate Research Assistant  
**Clemson University, 2022 - present,** [Project link](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~011bca7046def271ae?p=1848855747365720064)  
- Evaluated the security of SOTA object detectors DETR, Faster RCNN under adversarial examples.
- Tested on general and domain-specific autonomous driving scenario datasets.
- Secured the object detection by developing statistical-based anomaly detector.
- Utilized PyTorch for model development, Bash Scripting, GitHub, and CUDA for experimentation.

**Clemson University, 2020 - 2022,** [Project link](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/4/868)  
- Designed an AI-based smart grid and energy management system using MATLAB.
- Developed a Deep LSTM Neural Network (DLNN) to forecast the power demand of a microgrid.
- Assessed model performance under false data injection (FDI) and developed an integrated machine learning-based framework to enhance model resilience.
- ML-framework succeeded in detecting and removing FDI by 99% and recovering smart grid overall performance by about 30%.
